    <h3>
      Explanation:
    </h3>

    <h4>
      What does it mean?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Accessible media refers to images, videos, and audio features on a website. Each of these forms of media are
      inaccessible to people, so it is necessary to provide alternatives in some form to represent the information in a
      different way.
    </p>
    <h4>
      How do you do it?
    </h4>
    <p>
      This can easily be done by considering different disabilities that may cause visual or auditory impairments. Any
      images need alternate text describing the image, unless it is decorative. Any video or audio footage needs a
      transcript. Also, the site needs to use text and color variation, not just icons or color to communicate meaning.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Accessibility Example:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Accessible media is important for people with visual impairments that use screen readers because they would not be
      able to get the same information that a person without a disability would get from a video or an image. Also, a
      person that is deaf would not be able to hear the video and would need to read the information spoken in a
      transcript or captions.
