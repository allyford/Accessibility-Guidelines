      Explanation:
        </h3>
    
    <h4>
      What does it mean?
        </h4>
        <p>
            Wayfinding is how easy it is for users to navigate through your website. This is guided through cues, consistency, and alternatives. There should be orientation cues such as titles at the top of the page. The structure and navigation should be consistent from page to page and throughout the site. There should be multiple ways for a user to find what they are looking for, for example a search bar and a navigation bar.      
        </p>
    <h4>
      How do you do it?
        </h4>
        <p>
            Wayfinding can be simple to implement if a clear structure is set up by ensuring titles, descriptions, and navigation is clear and obvious. This needs to be done through landmarks in the code and through design. 
            </p>

      Accessibility Example:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Wayfinding is very helpful when using assistive technologies such as screen readers. For a person with blindness, they need constant assurance about where they are within your website because they cannot see the structure of the site. They need titles and landmarks, read to them through the screen reader, which help them know where they are and how to find what they are looking for.
