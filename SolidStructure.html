     Explanation:
       </h3>
   
   <h4>
     What does it mean?
       </h4>
       <p>
         A webpage with a solid structure has three main standards: 1) stable 2) robust 3) secure. The web page should have a stable structure that works across separate devices and platforms. It should be robust in that the site meets user needs and preferences. A secure site is trustworthy and has clear signs of reliable information. These should all signal support for assistive technologies.
       </p>
   <h4>
     How do you do it?
       </h4>
       <p>
         Along with a clear purpose, structure is important to solidify before adding design aspects. The information on the page should be organized and clear, using semantic markups such as headings to show structure and organization.

     Accessibility Example:
       </h3>
       <p>
         This guideline supports accessibility because it is necessary for the use of screen reading devices. People with blindness or low sight rely on the semantic markups and a logical sequence to organize the information on a site. As the screen readers simply read out the words written on the page, solid structure is one of the most important qualities.
