      Explanation:
        </h3>
    
    <h4>
      What does it mean?
        </h4>
        <p>
            This means that the site is easy for any user to use and understand without any previous knowledge. When difficult terms are used, they are explained and there is clear understanding by the user about what they should do when prompted to input any information.
           </p>
    <h4>
      How do you do it?
        </h4>
        <p>
            This can easily be done by using simple language and short, clear phrases and sentences. Any actionable items should show include clear direction. Any jargon or necessary complex language should be defined as best as possible.
          </p>
    <h3>
      Accessibility Example:
        </h3>
        <p>
            This guideline supports accessibility because it allows sites to be used by any user and does not lead to a user getting stuck in an interface. For a person that is not as experienced with technology (elderly, youth, or uneducated), these sites are more navigable and understandable.
            </p>
