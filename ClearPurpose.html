        Clear Purpose and Well-Defined Goals

    Explanation:
      </h3>
  
  <h4>
    What does it mean?
      </h4>
      <p>
        
        When you access a website, you would like the site to have a clear purpose. This means that it is clear what the page does and what goal it is attempting to achieve. The page should naturally direct you to that goal. When looking for a page to complete your specific goal, it should be obvious whether or not the page will help you or not.
  
      </p>
  <h4>
    How do you do it?
      </h4>
      <p>
        In order to fulfill this goal, it is necessary to design or plan out the user interface before creating the webpage. It is also easiest to define goals before beginning to ensure a clear focus for the content of the site.

  <h3>
    Accessibility Example:
      </h3>
      <p>
        This guideline supports accessibility because it is helpful for people with ADD or Autism who may be distracted or get frustrated by a site that is not simple and direct. In addition, for elderly people or others who are not as experienced with computers, it is easier to use the site if there is a clear purpose. Lastly, the simpler the page is, the easier it is for assistive technologies.
