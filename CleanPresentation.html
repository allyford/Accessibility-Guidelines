      Explanation:
        </h3>
    
    <h4>
      What does it mean?
        </h4>
        <p>
            Clean presentation refers to organization, easy to read font and color, and simplicity. Similar to a clear purpose, a clean presentation makes it simpler for a user to understand the goal and usability of the website.
                </p>
    <h4>
      How do you do it?
        </h4>
        <p>
            This can be done by using accessible Sans Serif fonts, clearly distinct colors (light/dark), and by keeping a lot of blank space. A simple design is best for clean presentation, less is more.
                    </p>
    <h3>
      Accessibility Example:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Similar to clear purpose, this guideline also supports accessibility because it is helpful for people with ADD or Autism who may be easily distracted and frustrated by clutter. By having a clean presentation, they will be able to use the site more efficiently.
           </p>
