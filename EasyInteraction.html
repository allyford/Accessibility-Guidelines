      Explanation:
        </h3>
    
    <h4>
      What does it mean?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Interaction is concerned with the ability for users to easily use the website. This includes navigation, completing tasks, and receiving information.
          </p>
    <h4>
      How do you do it?
        </h4>
        <p>
         During the design process, it is important to be cater to a general audience. A clear and simple design is the best way to do this. It can be difficult to know what users would and would not understand, so Usability Testing is a very valuable tool to check and see how a user interacts with your website.

    <h3>
      Accessibility Example:
        </h3>
        <p>
          This guideline supports accessibility because by designing for a general audience, the site is more accessible through assistive technologies. For a person with an arthritic disease, it can be painful and extraneous to try to navigate a difficult website or not be able to use the keyboard to navigate. By allowing the user to efficiently accomplish their goals and navigate in a way that they choose, they will be much more likely to use the website.
